          An ARIA Dialog Demo

        <p>
          Each of the following tests show off different features of the modal dialog script.
          For more information about the functionality and options of these dialog demos, see the
          <a href="https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_modal_window#accessible-modal-dialog">modal dialog documentation on GitHub</a>.

            Test information
          </summary>
          <p>
            Each dialog (presented here and on subsequent test pages) may have different focus start points for testing purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When each dialog is open, focus (via <kbd>tab</kbd> key or virtual cursor) should <strong>not</strong> be able to reach the document beneath the dialog. Browser chrome controls (browser buttons and address bar, etc.) <strong>should</strong> remain accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dialogs have been tested with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              JAWS 18 &amp; 2018 with Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 11.
            </li>
            <li>
              NVDA 2018.1 with Firefox and Chrome
            </li>
            <li>
              VoiceOver + macOS High Sierra and iOS 11
            </li>
            <li>
              TalkBack + Chrome on Android Oreo
            </li>

            <p>
              The button to activate the modal dialog is assigned its own unique ID, when activated the ID of the specific button used will be stored in a <code>var</code>. The ID will be referred to again when the dialog is closed and focus needs to return to the specific element that opened it.
            </p>
            <p>
              A close <code>button</code> is auto-generated from the script, as there are no manually coded close buttons within the dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this example the dialog container is focused by default.  This will result in JAWS + Firefox and VoiceOver (on desktop) announcing the accessible name and role of the dialog when its opened.
            </p>
            <p>
              With JAWS and Internet Explorer 11, the accessible name and role of the dialog will be announced, and then the first child element of the dialog, and its role, will be announced.
            </p>
            <p>
              With NVDA and Firefox, NVDA will announce the accessible name of the dialog, but will <b>not announce the dialog role</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              NVDA + Firefox and JAWS + Firefox will treat the focused dialog as if it was a new document loaded, and begin reading the contents of the dialog in sequential order.
